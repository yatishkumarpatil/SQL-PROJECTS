## Project Description

The essence of this project lies in its multifaceted SQL functionalities, encompassing user-defined SQL functions for fiscal year calculation, creation of detailed gross sales reports, and the design of stored procedures for dynamic sales reporting by customers and markets. The core objectives revolve around in-depth analysis of sales data, precise calculation of gross sales, and the segmentation of markets based on sales quantity.

## Project Objective

1. **User-Defined SQL Functions**: 

   - **get_fiscal_year**: Calculate the fiscal year for any given calendar date.
   - **get_fiscal_quarter**: Determine the fiscal quarter for a provided calendar date.

2. **Gross Sales Reports**:

   - **Gross Sales Report: Monthly Product Transactions**
   - **Gross Sales Report: Total Sales Amount**

3. **Stored Procedures**:

   - **get_monthly_gross_sales_for_customer**: Generate a detailed monthly gross sales report for any customer using this stored procedure.
   - **market_badge**: Obtain the market badge (Gold/Silver) based on the total quantity sold for a specific market and fiscal year.
   - **get_top_n_customers_by_net_sales**: Retrieve the top N customers by net sales in a given fiscal year and market.
   - **get_top_n_markets_by_net_sales**: Fetch the top N markets by net sales for a particular year.

## Project Action

1. **User-Defined SQL Functions**:

   - SQL statements to create functions like `get_fiscal_year` and `get_fiscal_quarter` within your database.

2. **Gross Sales Reports**:

   - SQL queries to generate gross sales reports based on the specified criteria.

3. **Stored Procedures**:

   - SQL statements to create the necessary stored procedures for generating sales reports for customers and markets.

## Achievements

This project has successfully automated the generation of financial reports, particularly focusing on gross sales. The stored procedures allow for dynamic and automated reporting for customers and markets, greatly enhancing efficiency and enabling timely decision-making based on accurate financial data.
